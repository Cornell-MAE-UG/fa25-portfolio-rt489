## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profilepic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

Hi! I am an undergraduate student at Cornell University studying the mechanical development of biotechnology, especially discoveries that enhance community relationships. 
I am currently most comfortable with bioanalytical skills on the micro level due to prior wet lab work but am open and interested in expanding my skill set to larger scale operations such as mechanical technology design. 
Outside of engineering, I'm passionate about community building and am intent on staying informed, through direct consulting, about current needs that need to be addressed.

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
