**STEP 1**
**Project Statement:** 

To design a frame/mechanism that can lift the maximum possible weight to the maximum possible height. We are to assume that the support and actuator are rigid.

**Constraints and Objectives:**

This project focused on the optimization of a 2D weight lifting apparatus. The device was designed using the restraint setup of three pin supports (two of which were attached to the base of the design space) as well as one rigid metal rod and one linear actuator device. The objective of the project was to lift the maximum possible weight to the maximum possible height. 

**My Design:**

To design this system, I chose an actuator (IMA55) that could produce a highly significant thrust force of 35.81 kN. Using this thrust force and the device specifications, the maximum possible weight carried by my design is 21.42 kN. The actuator was placed at the center of the rigid rod to optimize the output force against the weightage of the load.


**STEP 2**
**Project Statement**
This portion of the project assumes the bar is no longer rigid - the beam bends relative to the applied load. I am looking for a model of the system that is the most mass-efficient possible.

**Analysis of Method**
Since I want my beam to deflect no more than 2% of the length of the beam, I use 3 cm as my deflection constraint. Following, I use superposition to analyze the beam for mass and determine an I beam cross section that is efficient for this model.
